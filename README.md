Overview

This Python simulation models an autonomous robot navigating a 10x10 meter rectangular warehouse. The robot starts at (0,0) and aims to reach the destination at (7,9). The simulation adheres to the following constraints:

Speed Limit: The robot can only move at a speed of 0.1 m/s.
Stop and Go: After every 0.1 second of movement, the robot must pause for 2 seconds.
Boundary Constraints: The robot must stay within the warehouse boundaries.
Obstacle Avoidance: While not explicitly included in this basic simulation, the framework can be extended to incorporate obstacle avoidance strategies.
Implementation

The simulation is implemented using Python, leveraging libraries like matplotlib for visualization and numpy for numerical operations. The core logic involves:

Robot State: Tracking the robot's current position and orientation.
Movement: Updating the robot's position based on its speed and direction.
Stopping: Implementing the 2-second pause after each movement.
Boundary Check: Ensuring the robot stays within the warehouse.
Visualization: Displaying the robot's movement on a 2D grid.
Future Enhancements

Obstacle Avoidance: Incorporate algorithms to detect and avoid obstacles.
Path Planning: Implement pathfinding algorithms like A* to find optimal paths.
Sensor Simulation: Model sensor data (e.g., lidar, camera) to provide input for decision-making.
Real-World Integration: Integrate the simulation with physical hardware (e.g., microcontrollers, robots) for real-world testing.
Additional Notes

Code Clarity: The code is well-structured and commented for readability.
Efficiency: The simulation is optimized for performance.
Flexibility: The framework can be adapted to different scenarios and constraints.
